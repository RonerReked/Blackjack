# Blackjack
Created many years ago around 2014 (JAVA)

Creates a wallet.txt that it uses as a localdatabase, reads value in there which is your wallet and remaining $ for when you place bets.

This project was created many years ago and is very outdated but pushing it up to github is for my own personal progress review.

This has no frontend part so this project runs strictly in the terminal with logs.
